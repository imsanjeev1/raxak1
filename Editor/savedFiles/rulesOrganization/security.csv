For manual installations, select the ""Encrypt"" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots. 

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the ""--encrypted"" and ""--passphrase="" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition: 

part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]

Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the ""--passphrase="" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
